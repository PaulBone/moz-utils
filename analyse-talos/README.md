Talos scripts
=============

These scripts help you compare the output of Mozilla's talos jobs.  They're
written for the SpiderMonkey JavaScript shell, they may work in other
environments and maybe someone could put them on the web and allow them to
point directly to the jobs to compare, but they don't do that now.

Talos is a performance testing framework we use at Mozilla.  It helps us
spot performance regressions.  Unfortunately perfherder (another tool) only
allows us to compare batches of jobs and gives no information about what are
the differences between the subtests.  These scripts help with that.

You can get the test data from treehearder.  From the build, for example
"Linux x64 pgo" choose the test, eg T-e10s g5.  Then in the bottom pane
click job details and download the perfherder-data.json file.  Download each
of these for each job of the same kind.

analyse-talos.js
----------------

$ js analyse-talos.js data.json

This will report some statistics for the jobs in data.json.

merge-talos.js
--------------

$ js merge-talos.js data-1.json data-2.json data-3.json > data.json

This will merge the data files into one.  This is suitable when all these
files were generated by the same job type for the same build (so that
perfherder could compare multiple results).
